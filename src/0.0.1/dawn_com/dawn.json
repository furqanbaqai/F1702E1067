He also expressed concern over the exorbitant fee structure of medical colleges and summoned the chief executives of all 14 private medical and dental colleges in Lahore to furnish details of their bank accounts and the amount of fee they charged for the present session from students, in addition to submitting affidavits about meeting PMDC criteria.The colleges were directed to submit their prospectus, number of seats available and how many of them had been filled on merit and quota basis and the charges collected from students besides fee fixed by the PMDC. The court also restrained all unrecognised private medical colleges from carrying out admission. The two-judge bench hearing the case today asked the Punjab chief secretary to brief the court on the fee structure of medical colleges, and said that there must be a policy allowing students who could not afford to pay the fee to take admission in medical institutions. The chief secretary, however, assured the court that the Punjab government had enough funds to ensure that students who could not afford a medical education due to lack of financial resources, could be admitted to colleges on the basis of merit. The CJP, who is heading the bench, was insistent that the court would not \"hesitate from contacting philanthropists if that is what it takes to allow lesser-privileged students to get a medical education.\"Justice Nisar also ordered that the details of hospitals' bank accounts and other financial details be submitted in court in the next hearing.Governor Punjab Muhammad Rafiq Rajwana's son, who had on Wednesday been accused of  involved in the case, issued an unconditional apology in court today claiming that the prosecutor, Advocate Anjum Hameed, was \"like his mother\" and that they had family ties as well.

The Afghan government has suffered during operations against the Taliban. Our position is that both sides should sit at the table and resolve the issue. The IS concentration in Afghanistan is a matter of concern for all. This was stated by the consul general of the Russian Federation in Karachi, Dr Aleksandr G. Khozin, while answering a question after an hour-long, detailed address to the press highlighting Russia\u2019s position on Europe, the Palestinian-Israel situation, the Syrian situation and Pakistan-Russia ties.In response to a query on the Palestine issue, Dr Khozin said both [Israel and Palestine] sides needed to be persuaded to talk to each other. What\u2019s clear was that Muslim countries would not understand the behaviour of the US on the issue.Speaking about President Trump\u2019s election in the US, he said it\u2019s the choice of the American public. It\u2019s up to America who to choose as its president. The Russian president was ready to discuss issues with them [America].Earlier, during his briefing Dr Khozin said the Russian foreign office believed in peaceful coexistence, and it was peace that could bring security [to the world]. But no one had the right to dictate to any country how to exist or what was good for it. America\u2019s efforts to become a unipolar power had failed as old crises remained unresolved and new challenges emerged. In a multipolar world there could be more diversity and acceptance of one another\u2019s traditions, culture and faith. Any attempt to slow down this process would lead to creating instability. The world we lived in demanded an acceptance of diverse traditions, which would eventually sustain its growth.On the situation in Syria, the consul general expressed similar views. He said no one had the right to dictate what would be its future course. It\u2019s up to the Syrian people to decide how to lead their lives. \u201cWe will continue to support Syria,\u201d he remarked underlining Russia\u2019s position on the Arab country.On the Palestinian-Israel situation, Dr Khozin said on Dec 21, 128 countries voted in favour of a UN resolution and America threatened those who had voted against its stance that they would risk losing its aid and support. The US position could further complicate the situation in the region, whereas Russia\u2019s position on the issue had not changed: it spoke in favour of direct talks between Israel and Palestine.On Nato forces\u2019 expansion near Russia\u2019s border, Dr Khozin said it would increase tensions in the area. \u201cWe are taking measures to increase our capacity.\u201d Talking about the peacekeeping mission in Ukraine, he said Ukraine refused Russia\u2019s proposal in that regard. He pointed out that the US was supplying arms to Ukraine.Coming to Russia-Pakistan ties, Dr Khozin said recently on the sidelines of the General Assembly sessions the foreign ministers of the two countries met and discussed Afghanistan and counter-terrorism. He claimed that in the last three to four years the Pak-Russia relationship had strengthened. Both countries were trying to find ways to bring about peace in the region. \u201cWe support each other.\u201dDr Khozin said trade between Pakistan and Russia had increased considerably in recent times. Business links were getting stronger as governments of the two countries looking at areas that could prove mutually beneficial.Responding to the question of whether Russian President Vladimir Putin would visit Pakistan, he said diplomats\u2019 job was to build bridges. It\u2019s up to Mr Putin to visit Pakistan.", "section": "main", "index": "7", "authur": "Peerzada Salman", "fetchedTime": "2017-12-28 07:46:36"},

According to an official press release, the chief minister will hold \u2018important\u2019 meetings in the kingdom, besides performing Umra. No word was given about the nature of the meetings. The departure, however, set many tongues wagging as Mr Sharif travelled in a special plane sent by the kingdom. Also the visit came at the heels of his nomination as the PML-N candidate for the prime minister office. A couple of days ago, Saudi Ambassador to Pakistan Admiral Nawaf Ahmad Al Maliki, along with envoys of around two dozen countries, had called on the chief minister. Federal Climate Change Minister Mushahidullah Khan told Dawn by phone that various issues of international and national importance would be discussed during the meetings in Saudi Arabia. He termed the visit good news for the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz, but did not elaborate it. Punjab Law Minister Rana Sanaullah, a close aide to the chief minister, seconded Mr Khan\u2019s views and said: \u201cMian Shahbaz Sharif will definitely discuss issues of national importance \u2014 not just of Punjab \u2014 with his Saudi hosts. Saudi Arabia has been our trusted brotherly country for decades and we are relying on it in many economic and other matters of international importance.\u201d A PML-N leader, who requested not to be named, said that for many years the United States used to play its role in Pakistani politics through Saudi Arabia and the chief minister\u2019s visit should be seen in that perspective. In response to a question, he said the Panama Papers case, besides other issues, would definitely figure in the meetings. He said Shahbaz Sharif presently was not in a position to offer anything to the Saudis but could promise something in the future. The opposition also senses that to its disadvantage as the visit is being used to build stature of the chief minister as future prime minister of the country. Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf\u2019s spokesman Fawad Chaudhry said they\u2019re concerned at the visit undertaken without any prior notice to any authority or institution. He said people should be taken into confidence about the purpose and objectives of the visit. The Sharifs used to enjoy good relations with the Saudis who had rescued them from military ruler Gen Pervez Musharraf in 2000 and hosted the family during its seven-year exile in Jeddah. But the relations got sour after Islamabad refused to lend Riyadh its forces for the Yemen war. Some believe that the issue was instrumental in making some Gulf states cooperate with Pakistani authorities in the Panama Papers investigations against then prime minister Nawaz Sharif. They also showed their fury by not allowing Mr Sharif to speak at the Arab-Islamic-American summit also attended by US President Donald Trump. Meanwhile, PML-N chief Nawaz Sharif held a consultative meeting in Lahore to finalise schedule for his public meetings in Punjab.", "section": "main", "index": "0", "authur": "Amjad Mahmood", "fetchedTime": "2017-12-28 07:46:36"}
